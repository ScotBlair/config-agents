- Step 2<br />
Fill out the information accordingly with First and Last Name, Email Address, etc.  Now click on "Set Password."
*Note: Make sure to add a contact phone number.  I did not in this example for obvious reasons.*

- Step 3<br />
Make sure "Send the agent a password reset email" is checked.  Click "Set."
*Note: If you uncheck "Send the agent a password reset email," you can to set the password manually.  Since my agent doesn't have an actual email address, this is what I had to do.  A new checkbox option will then appear saying "Require password change at next login."*
