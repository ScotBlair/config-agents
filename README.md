- Step 2<br />
Fill out the information accordingly with First and Last Name, Email Address, etc.  Now click on "Set Password."<br />
*Note: Make sure to add a contact phone number.  I did not in this example for obvious reasons.*

  *Note: If you uncheck "Send the agent a password reset email," you can to set the password manually.  Since my agent doesn't have an actual email address, this is what I had to do.  A new checkbox option will then appear saying "Require password change at next login."*

- Step 4<br />
Click the "Access" tab and assign the agent to a department.  I chose "Support" and gave him "All Access."
